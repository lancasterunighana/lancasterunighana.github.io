The Graduation Ceremony and Sharing Practice event for the first cohort of LUG Faculty to complete the International Post-Graduate Certificate of Academic Practice Programme (popularly known as PGCAP or iCAP) took place on 19th April, 2018 at the LUG A&C Campus.

This event was to celebrate the faculty members who had completed the two year programme, and give some of them a chance to share results of the pedagogical topic that each lecturer on the programme had to explore during the final module. 

PGCAP (International iCAP), is a post graduate certificate in academic practice designed to support initial teaching development of university staff who teach Lancaster University modules. Its aim is to encourage substantive teaching in staff and also offer learning support which includes module/programme design and development. It also provides staff with a flexible framework to be able to enhance and accredit their professional practice and also to develop their particular interest in teaching and student learning. The programme fosters a dynamic, cross-disciplinary community of practitioners to share ideas and develop a discourse about educational practice. Miss Coomerene Rodrigo, the LUG Academic Skills Coordinator oversaw the programme on the Ghana campus, under the supervision of Simon Allen, and Dr Chris Longman from the Lancaster University UK campus. 

iCAP gave participants an opportunity to enhance their understanding of curriculum, and teaching and learning by identifying a particular area of importance to them, exploring it through existing research and literature, and identifying potential opportunities and strategies for change. Four of the graduates presented the research they did in their particular area of interest, which cut across various disciplines including Computer Science, Law and Accounting & Finance. The faculty members who presented were Mrs Gifty Abban, an Accounting & Finance lecturer, Mr Kenneth Ghartey, Law Lecturer and Programme Coordinator, Mr Yaw Busia, Computer Science Lecturer and Programme Coordinator, and  Dr Lawrence Boakye, a Politics & International Relations Lecturer. Their presentations sparked up discussions on the different methods of teaching and learning, and they were also able to receive feedback from their fellow colleagues. 

After the sharing practice, ten members of our Faculty were presented with their certificates.
