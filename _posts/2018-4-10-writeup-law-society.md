***Lancaster University Ghana’s Law Society***


The law society of Lancaster University Ghana is a society whose members are strictly law students however, some exceptions have been made in the past for extraordinary services to the society. It entered its third year of existence in 2018. The purpose of the society was to create an enabling environment for law students to network, help each other and strive to be beyond mortality. It came about as a result of the need to foster greater unity within the Student Union. Also, to provide a good platform for law students to interact with others outside the university and also to cater to the professional needs of Law students whatever those needs may be. They don’t have regular meeting days but hold general meetings occasionally and meet during events.

***Activities and Events***


The law society is known for their annual law week celebration, bake sales and occasional carwash fundraisers. The law week kicks off with an opening ceremony with key speakers and special guests. The Tuesday is characterized by the Nsawam Prisons Visit where the society gives back to the society by giving items to the prisoners, this is usually only organized for the first years whilst the second and third years would participate in a career seminar where seasoned lawyers and legal practitioners tell us what being a lawyer or having a career in the legal sphere is like. They also provide practical advice on what to expect, challenges etc. On the Wednesday, students lead by presenting on topics they would be writing about in the society’s law journal. On Thursday, they put their legal skills to use in a mock court set up and on Friday end the week with a dinner where they network with people in the legal circle.
