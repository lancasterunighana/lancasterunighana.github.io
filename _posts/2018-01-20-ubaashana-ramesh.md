**What is your major and graduating year?**

Final year student studying Computer Science graduating in 2018.

 **What do you plan on doing after graduation?**
 
 After graduation, I plan on getting a job to be able to practice the things I have learnt. 

 **What is your favourite memory in university?**
 
I took a project in the first year of university with five other girls – TAG team. The project was called “Inspire a Child”. We took a government school and met with the children (age range = 13 to 16 years) for the project. We conducted essay competitions and selected the best 2 students who had the opportunity to engage in a one day session with a career personnel. The outcome of the project was very well appreciated by Lancaster University Ghana and management.

 **What is one thing that you gained during your life at university which you feel was of immense value?**
 
 The fact that the lecturers are very approachable allows me to have access to a wealth of information and this continues to be very valuable to me. 

**Any advice that you have for those who want to come to Lancaster and your juniors?**

University Ghana is the best place with high class lecturers who are willing to help students anytime in any domain (not only in my department but any lecturer from any department). This allows any student to feel at home. The lecturers also give in-depth knowledge in any field which is very helpful. Make sure you use this for your benefit as it will help you in the long run. 


**Do you have any projects that you are working on/have worked on that is being supported by Lancaster University Ghana?**

Being a computer science student has challenged me to be innovative and provide solutions to things in the society. I worked with a group of 5 members including myself to develop a software application that enabled students to book break-out rooms on campus. The lecturers and management commended my team and I for a great job well done on identifying problems with booking the break-out rooms and providing a practical solution to it using the skills I am learning in the university.
