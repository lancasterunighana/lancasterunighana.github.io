**What is your major and graduating year?**

Law and I’ll be graduating in 2020.

 **What do you plan on doing after graduation?**
 
 After graduating I want to gain admission at the Ghana Law School and further my professional course to pass the bar to become a lawyer at the Supreme Court of Ghana. I want to go into family law. I personally like legal related issues that concern families like divorce, taxation and basically just litigation. 

 **What is your favourite memory in university?**
 
 My first favourite memory at LUG was when I made it the first time to the Provost List in my first semester after being motivated by the foundation teachers. They helped me a lot and taught me to push myself more and made me realise that they sky is not the limit.

 **What is one thing that you gained during your life at university which you feel was of immense value?**
 
 I think networking. LUG provides different platforms on campus for students to network and interact with different people from different cultural backgrounds – you get to know their values and what makes them unique. Networking is imperative to your success outside school. Building external relationships will help you in your professional career – that is what I believe.

**Any advice that you have for those who want to come to Lancaster and your juniors?**

To excel in university, one must set their priorities straight, set time up for your education by studying hard and whilst at it, build relationships – get to know each other and have fun doing it.

**Do you have any external projects that you are working on outside university, what are they?**

I am thinking of doing something similar to Lancaster’s annual run for autism but mine will be called Ride For Dyslexia. I plan to involve people from other universities so that we can ride and raise funds for children with dyslexia. I am currently still at the planning stage and looking forward to recruiting people for this project.


**Do you have any projects that you are working on/have worked on that is being supported by Lancaster University Ghana?**

Not at the moment
