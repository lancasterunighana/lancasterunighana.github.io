**What is your major and graduating year?**

Law and in First Year graduating in 2020

 **What do you plan on doing after graduation?**
 
 I plan on attending the law school at Makola (Ghana) to finish with law and then hopefully move to the UK for a few years, and then to return to Ghana to settle. I am interested in corporate law. Â 

 **What is your favourite memory in university?**
 
 My favourite memory was a time that we wrote a Math test and the results came out and when it was shared I was the highest score in class it made me happy because I came here to be an excellent student and so that gave me more satisfaction. Their words of encouragement were enough for me since my lecturer said I was a genius. 

 **What is one thing that you gained during your life at university which you feel was of immense value?**
 
One thing that I have learnt is that honouring deadlines is key. I believe that if we are to be great leaders then we need to have this embedded in us. This is extensively practised in LUG and I have suffered for being late which I did not like. I was 5 mins late to class and I was made to stand outside for the rest of lecture. From that time on, I made sure to always get to class in time. Another instance was when a percentage was taken from my final mark for a course because I submitted my assignment late. The penalty attached late submissions get students to ensure that they honour deadlines.

**Any advice that you have for those who want to come to Lancaster and your juniors?**

I would like to tell my juniors to have a burning thirst to pursue excellence and make the fees you pay worth it. Fun is good but before and while they are having fun they should be conscious of the purpose for which they came to school. They can do this by focusing and getting forehand knowledge on the courses studied by networking with their classmates and students in the years above them. Setting personal timetables and deadlines and adhering to these will also help a great deal (actually something I'm still learning to do).

**Do you have any external projects that you are working on outside university, what are they?**

At the moment I am not working on any project but I intend to after my degree. Lancaster teaches us to give back to society and that is exactly what I intend to do


**Do you have any projects that you are working on/have worked on that is being supported by Lancaster University Ghana?**

Lancaster has helped to promote a project I managed dubbed "A Thousand Greens", which basically aimed to create awareness on the importance of planting of trees in Ghana. This was a project management project. Thorough this opportunity given by Lancaster, my team (The Check mates) was able to do this via TV, Newspaper and Radio and also presented the project charter to the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources (Minister John Peter Amewu) and we also got the opportunity to go to some schools to broadcast the vision of the project.
