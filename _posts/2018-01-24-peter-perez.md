**What is your major and graduating year?**

My major is Computer Science and I will be graduating in 2019

 **What do you plan on doing after graduation?**
 
I plan on giving back to African societies by developing I.T solutions that would solve little and major problems in various sectors of African livelihoods. 

 **What is your favourite memory in university?**
 
I think my favourite thing about Lancaster University is the fluent communication and collaboration with students from diverse backgrounds.

 **What is one thing that you gained during your life at university which you feel was of immense value?**
 
One of the major gains I am still enjoying as a student is that I can achieve whatever I want to because the guidance and resources are readily available at all times.

**Any advice that you have for those who want to come to Lancaster and your juniors?**

I personally will testify that a lot is expected from every student at Lancaster University and so I will advise new students to always make sure that academic excellence is taken as primary priority.

**Do you have any external projects that you are working on outside university, what are they?**

I currently host a YouTube series (a vlog channel where I advise young people like myself and also organize short challenges to make it more fun). As a computer scientist in the making, I am currently working on a project with students from other universities (a 100% anonymity platform). And I also contribute to open source projects online (GitHub).


**Do you have any projects that you are working on/have worked on that is being supported by Lancaster University Ghana?**

I have worked with a team to develop an android audio player for the visually impaired and we are still modifying it. We aim to create wearable for devices so the blind can use hands to feel shapes which will indicate: play, pause, next and previous. I worked with a project management group to design the first ever Lancaster University Academic Calendar for the year 2016. I am also at the planning stage of a ‘Geo-location system’ that can tell you the exact room, class or spot your friend is at within the premises of Lancaster University Ghana.
