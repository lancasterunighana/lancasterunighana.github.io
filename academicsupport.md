## Counselling and Mental Health Service Unit

If you are experiencing problems that are affecting your studies or general wellbeing, get in touch. The Counselling and Mental Health Unit is here to help! 
This unit was set up to provide accessible and quality services to students and staff to ensure that they have sound mental health and general wellbeing. 
According to the World Health Organization [WHO] (2003), Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. 
Guided by the definition of health by the WHO, We aim to provide counselling services to students to ensure that they are in a complete state of health in order to have a smooth academic experience.
