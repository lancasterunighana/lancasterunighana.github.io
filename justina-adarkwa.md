**What is your major and graduating year?**

I am studying Economics and International Relations and will be graduating in 2018.

 **What do you plan on doing after graduation?**
 
 I plan on going on to do a Masters or PhD in Development Studies, then working for the UN, and hopefully the public sector of my country Ghana as an Ambassador or Minister. 

 **What is your favourite memory in university?**
 
 I've had many great experiences here and I hope my next year will be even better, so my answer to this is that hopefully, my favourite memory is yet to happen.

 **What is one thing that you gained during your life at university which you feel was of immense value?**
 
 I have been blessed to meet many of the future leaders of not only Ghana but Africa as a whole in my classrooms and in Lancaster's hallways, and I greatly treasure the relationships I have with these intelligent and inspiring people. 

**Any advice that you have for those who want to come to Lancaster and your juniors?**

I would encourage anyone in or about to come to Lancaster to see everything as an opportunity, even failures. The only time I reckon failures are anything to be ashamed of is when you, the individual, allow them to impede you from pursuing and ultimately achieving your goals and dreams. I would even go as far as to say that failure can even be a great set-up for success, since they make you aware of the need for growth, help you identify the area in need growth, and induce a desire for success. So seize every opportunity (taking into account your priorities of course) because to be an overcomer, you must have had something to overcome.

**Do you have any projects that you are working on/have worked on that is being supported by Lancaster University Ghana?**

I was honoured to be a part of the inaugural Ghanaian internship team for the Richardson Institute Internship Programme (Lancaster University, UK), where my colleagues and I researched on peace and conflict specifically between the Northern and Southern regions of Ghana and we came up with findings in the form of a dissertation to add to the literature concerning the subject and provided possible solutions to the causes of conflict within these areas. Additionally, the Politics and Debate Society of which I am President has received generous support from the university like all the other clubs to be able to host and execute events that are close to our hearts. 
Both of these ventures would not have been possible without the support of LUG and all its resources, especially its staff.</p>
